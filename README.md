# React Task Management Test Project

## Description
This project is a simple web application where users can write and add notes.

## Installation
Clone the project and make sure you have `json-server` installed. Additionally, ensure that React and TypeScript are properly set up.

## Features
Users can perform basic CRUD operations via the API (GET, GET_BY_ID, CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE).
State management is handled using the `useState` hook, and side effects are managed using the `useEffect` hook.
The `useContext` hook has been utilized to prevent unnecessary complexity in passing parameters.
API requests are managed from a central location.

## Technologies Used
- React
- TypeScript
- React Hooks
- Json-server

## Contributions to Me
This was my first project with React, which helped me learn the React structure and understand functional programming (as someone with an OOP background, I can say FP offers very different approaches).
